# Certificate Revocation Fix

## Problem
The original implementation had a critical flaw in the certificate revocation system:
- **Revocation only deleted files from IPFS** (Pinata)
- **Blockchain records remained intact**
- **Verification still showed certificates as valid** because `isVerified()` only checked if the certificate existed on blockchain

## Solution
Implemented proper blockchain-based revocation:

### 1. Smart Contract Updates (`contracts/Certification.sol`)
- Added `revokedCertificates` mapping to track revoked certificates
- Added `revokeCertificate()` function to mark certificates as revoked
- Updated `isVerified()` to check both existence AND revocation status
- Added `isRevoked()` function to check revocation status
- Added `certificateRevoked` event for tracking

### 2. Institute Interface Updates (`application/pages/institute/institute.py`)
- **Dual revocation**: Now revokes on blockchain AND deletes from IPFS
- **Error handling**: Proper error messages for blockchain/IPFS failures
- **Success feedback**: Clear confirmation of successful revocation

### 3. Verifier Interface Updates (`application/pages/verifier/verifier.py`)
- **Revocation checking**: Verifies if certificate is revoked before validation
- **Clear messaging**: Shows "REVOKED" status for invalid certificates
- **Reference data**: Shows certificate details even for revoked certificates

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Using Makefile
```bash
# Start fresh deployment
make redeploy
```

### Option 2: Using Python Script
```bash
# Deploy and update configuration
python deploy_contracts.py
```

### Option 3: Manual Steps
```bash
# 1. Start Ganache
ganache-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 8545

# 2. Compile contracts
truffle compile

# 3. Deploy contracts
truffle migrate --reset

# 4. Update deployment_config.json with new contract address
```

## How It Works Now

### Certificate Generation
1. Institute generates certificate PDF
2. Uploads to IPFS (Pinata)
3. Stores certificate data on blockchain
4. Certificate is now valid and verifiable

### Certificate Revocation
1. Institute clicks "Revoke" button
2. **Blockchain**: Calls `revokeCertificate()` function
3. **IPFS**: Deletes file from Pinata
4. Certificate is now marked as revoked on blockchain

### Certificate Verification
1. Verifier uploads PDF or enters Certificate ID
2. **Existence check**: Verifies certificate exists on blockchain
3. **Revocation check**: Checks if certificate is revoked
4. **Result**: 
   - ✅ Valid: Certificate exists and not revoked
   - ❌ Revoked: Certificate exists but is revoked
   - ❌ Invalid: Certificate doesn't exist

## Testing the Fix

1. **Generate a certificate** as an Institute
2. **Verify the certificate** as a Verifier (should show as valid)
3. **Revoke the certificate** as an Institute
4. **Verify the certificate again** as a Verifier (should show as revoked)

## Benefits
- ✅ **True revocation**: Certificates can be properly invalidated
- ✅ **Blockchain integrity**: Revocation status is immutable
- ✅ **Clear feedback**: Users know exactly why verification failed
- ✅ **Audit trail**: Revocation events are logged on blockchain
- ✅ **Backward compatibility**: Existing certificates still work

## Security Considerations
- Only the original institute can revoke certificates (through authentication)
- Revocation is permanent and immutable on blockchain
- IPFS deletion provides additional security layer
- Revocation events are logged for audit purposes
