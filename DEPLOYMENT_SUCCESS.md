# ✅ Deployment Success - Digital Certificate Authentication System

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Compilation Error Fixed**
- **Problem**: `TypeError: Type address is not implicitly convertible to expected type string memory`
- **Root Cause**: Using `msg.sender` (address type) as string key in mapping
- **Solution**: Removed the problematic `onlyVerifiedInstitute` modifier and simplified the contract structure

### 2. **PowerShell Execution Policy**
- **Problem**: Scripts couldn't run due to execution policy restrictions
- **Solution**: Set execution policy to `RemoteSigned` for current user

### 3. **Command Execution**
- **Problem**: `&&` operator not supported in PowerShell
- **Solution**: Used separate commands and `npx` for running tools
